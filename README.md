server-side-collection
======================


University of Iowa Cyberbullying Research

This project is designed to be run to collect the Facebook and Twitter data of the users registed with the cyberbullying study.
It requests the list of access tokens from the server, downloads the data, and the uploads it back to the server.

The collection tool uses the Facebook4j and Twitter4j libraries.

This is a maven project, so import it as such into Eclipse.
